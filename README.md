### About
Analyzing a dataset and building predictive models with Python that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm. Relevant Python Packages: numpy, Pandas, Scipy, seaborn, Matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn

### Overview
This project served as the capstone of my Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate (2024) and here is a cleaned up, modified representation of the Jupyter notebook file.

### Business understanding
The goal of with this project is to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

### Data understanding
This is the complete code notebook for analyzing employee data for Salifort Motors, looking specifically at why the turnover rate is so high, looking to compare variables to find correlations to shed some light on the situation and potential ways to raise over satisfaction scores and ultimately retain more employees.

### Modeling and evaluation
Relevent Python packages: numpy, Pandas, Scipy, seaborn, Matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn
