## Visualizing employee satisfaction comparisons in Python

### About
Analyzing a dataset and building predictive models with Python that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm. Relevant Python Packages: numpy, Pandas, Scipy, seaborn, Matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn

### Overview
This project served as the basis for the capstone of my Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate (01/2024)—which a cleaned up version of the Jupyter notebook file is included in this repository ([python_satisfaction.ipynb](https://github.com/i-am-nate/python-satisfaction/blob/main/python_satisfaction.ipynb)). The accompanying .csv ([HR_capstone_dataset.csv](https://github.com/i-am-nate/python-satisfaction/blob/main/HR_capstone_dataset.csv)) is third-party data synthesized and provided by Google and the Coursera certificate course from which this capstone project originated, and it is used by permsission.

The problem the business was trying to solve — in this case, the fictitious Salifort Motors — was looking at why the turnover rate is so high and to shed some light on potential ways to raise satisfaction scores (and ultimately retain more employees).

### Business understanding
The goal of with this project is to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

### Data understanding
This is the complete code notebook for analyzing employee data for Salifort Motors, 

### Modeling
